# Welcome

![](getting_started/img/intro.jpg)

Please consider reading through this manual before purchasing preview. The main limitations are:

- Use only the bundled Armory PBR node for materials. Node parser is currently being rewritten for more efficiency.
- Armory player renders always on top, hiding popups as a result.
- No open world data streaming / LOD support.
- Minimal docs / API functionality out of the box.
- Graphical effects require more tweaking.
- Python / JS scripts not supported on native targets.
- Very few logic nodes implemented.
- Likely breaking backward compatibility.

To reach the first release, all of these issues need to get resolved.
