		<h1>Preview testing</h1>
		<p>(November/11/2016)</p>
		<p>It has been over a week of the first ever Armory testing and the amount of feedback is staggering. Tons and tons of bugs were reported - thank you! Seeing all the different Armory use-cases that one would never think of is fantastic.</p>

		<p>Today, Build 2 is out to address some of the top issues. And maybe bring a new bug or two, as it usually goes. Everything is still broken but at times it can already get super fun to just mess around.</p>
