		<h1>Armory Preview Version</h1>
		<p>(current revision: 16.09)</p>
		<p>Preview version will be avaialble soon! Before purchasing, please <b>read the manual</b> first to know what parts need more work.</p>
		<p><b>Estimated price</b>: USD 49 / EUR 43 / GBP 37</p>

		<p>While we are still looking for ways to make Armory free, you can support the project directly and get the preview version. We do not plan to sell any separate modules or force splash screens. Everyone accessing the preview version will of course receive all <b>future releases for free</b>. Careful though, the preview version will likely have many rough edges and the experience may be frustrating!</p>

		<p>Please note that eventually, as the project matures, we would love making it free. The funds are (unfortunatelly!) needed to <b>actively develop</b> project. No one would like to use an engine that is not well maintaned. We also plan to split part of the revenue to <b>Blender and Kha</b>, which are the basic blocks of Armory.</p>
